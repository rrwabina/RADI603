UHC Goals influenced by Health Financing Policy 
    (1) Revenue Raising - Taxation (e.g., value added tax from people's consumption)
            - Out-of-pocket (OOP) payments people pay thru OOP

    From the resource generation, a country creates a policy of benefit packages
            - Which programs/services are free and accessible to the public?

A country should aim to cover all the essential axes in the three dimensions of UHC. However, the world is still a long way from UHC. 
    1. Acces to health services
    2. Poor finanical risk protection 
    3. Other determining factors

Strengthening heatlhcare financing system 

World Health Orgnanization (WHO) uses health indicators to assess the effectivity of healthcare access to a country. In the Philippines, the average life expectancy is only 71 years old.
In Thailand, the life expectancy at birth of Thais is 76 years old for male while 82 years old for female. 

THE IMPACT OF IMPLEMENTING UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE IN THAILAND 
    1. Thailand introduced the Universal Health Coverage on 2002 after the Asian Financial Crisis on 1997. 
    2. The GDP per capita at 2002 is only 1870 USD
    3. Prior to 2002, seventy per cent of Thailand's population consists of uninsured individual - informal sector
    4. When Thailand introduiced UHC, they used a tax-financed scheme to pay for the people's insurance (UCS) where 80 per cent of Thailand's population are insured. 
        Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS)
        Insurance schemes in Thailand  
            a. Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme
            b. Social Health Insurance
            c. Universal Health Coverage - farmers, street vendors, and other people who are not from CSMBS or SHI 
        30USD per capita per person is allocated for one person
Capitation - they pay 900 baht from social security schemes - i.e., contracting payment
There are still unfinished agenda on the Unversal Health Coverage in Thailand. They wanted to consolidate the three schemes on a single option due to 
political affairs. The Social Security, however, has a lower coverage than the other schemes. Social Security also needs to pay their tripartite contributions. 
    - Common medications are not covered in Social Security Schemes - e.g., cough, fever. These medications, however, are covered in the Universal Health Coverage. 

SYSTEM DESING OF THAI UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE
    Their main priority is the removal if financial barriers. 
    Thailand is also proposing the Migrant Health Insurance Protection, suitable for migrant workers within Thailand

The number of household prevented from medical improverishment has dramatically decreased when universal health coverage was estbalished in Thailand last 2002. 
Condom intervention also helped Thailand to decrease ethe number of new HIV infection and death cases. Thailand is the second country in the world to end HIV transmission

Thailand also invested mroe on district hospitals. Every district has at least one community district hospital. Every province has one general hospital. 
Medical doctors also require themselves to undergo a 2-year rural integration in Thailand.
